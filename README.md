# zero_to_docs

Materials to help you go from zero to full documentation as quickly as possible.

This repository contains the following directories:

docs/
  The Sphinx source of the documentation.
my_package/
  An example Python package.  We'll grab docstrings from this package and
  generate documentation for it.
examples/
  Visual examples that illustrate the use of `my_package`.  These examples
  will be turned into a gallery.
